analyticalg assessing against a set of criteria methods have been used for assessment However research shows that the different methods have their pitfalls and shortcomings A method that has recently been propagated mainly from the angle of educational assessment is comparative assessment At the basis of this method are insights from psychology that show that people are better able to compare objects than to assign a score to them one by one on a certain characteristic A speech therapist then assesses two speech languages for example and determines which of the two is most intelligible Such judgments appear to be more reliable than assigning a holistic score The goal of this project is twofold First we want to investigate the generalizability of comparative judging and its m rites in the domain of speech research Then we want to extend the method itself and develop an appropriate statistical model Generalization the method of pairwise comparison is especially emerging in the broad domain of measuring competencies in the educational context In this project we want to closely examine the generalizability of comparative assessment to other domains in which people assess especially in the domain of the scientific study of speech More specifically we ask the question does comparative assessment lead to reliable valid and efficient assessments of the intelligibility of young childrenspeech Extension the current form of comparative assessment is limited to a simple pairwise comparison idichotomous choosing between two alternatives The reason is that the statistical model used to model the data the Bradley Terry Luce model only allows for dichotomous data However pairwise comparison can be extended to ordinal and scale based ways of selection and in addition it may be important to take a multidimensional approach to assessment comparing on multiple underlying aspects of intelligibility In this study we extend the statistical model into a generic model that helps to analyze different forms of data ,"['0501', '0602']",b how to make intelligibility measurement intelligible a methodological study extend the framework of comparative judgement suppose a

implant']",Bilateral loss of vestibular function is a very debilitating disorder which can lead to a broad spectrum of symptoms like for example postural instability impairment of spatial orientation and a distorted vision oscillopsia Patients with bilateral vestibular impairment often need to alter their activities They need to perform them slower with greater attention or some will even be avoided This can strongly impact quality of life as it can lead to a decrease of physical activity and social functioning and can increase the risk of falling times Up until now no effective treatment is available for chronic bilateral vestibulopathy Physical therapy can be helpful but it is not always sufficient Progress is being made with devices specifically targeting certain deficits caused by BV but no treatment option to reestablish the full functionality of the vestibular organs exists today In response to this therapeutic absence the concept of a vestibular prosthesis in analogy with a cochlear prosthesis for treating deafness is an ongoing and important field of research One of the vestibular implants VI in development is the Cochleovestibular implant CVI This is cochlear implant CI adjusted to form an additional vestibular implant In the normal CI implant all electrodes are arranged along one array designed for a full insertion inside the cochlea In the CVI implant the three most basal electrodes are separated from the main electrode branch into three individual branches These three individual branches are designed to be inserted into the semicircular canals SCCs to allow for stimulation of the vestibular nerves The remaining electrodes make up the cochlear array designed to be inserted in the cochlea analogous to a regular CI Reallocating the electrodes within the vestibulocochlear organ offers the opportunity to stimulate the vestibular nerves while maintaining CI functionality in order to restore hearing The implant aims to provide the central nervous system with information about spatial orientation and movement A sensor containing accelerometers and gyroscopes is applied to the patients head where it measures head angular velocity and linear acceleration in all axes of movement The measured signals are then transduced into electric signals which are delivered to the vestibular nerves by the implanted electrodes Implantation of the vestibular system is a very delicate procedure as semicircular canals are very small and opening up these canals can cause hearing loss Furthermore the best electrode position for optimal functional results and best operative technique still need to be determined Overall in this project we aim to develop a safer and more efficient VI by studying possible improvements in the surgical technique and investigating the electrode positioning based on objective intra and postoperative parameters With this research we aim to develop a functional prosthesis which can provide a good treatment option for
